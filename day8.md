# Day 8

We're over the hump! Or so I am told. Today's lesson had the most material I am completely unfamiliar with out of all the lessons so far. Up until now, I had used html attributes to handle events and I'm very glad we're learning another (better) way to do it. That being said, I was stuck for a while, admittedly more than 15 minutes, trying to get an event listener to fire on a dynamically created table row. It still isn't working, so I'll trouble shoot it tomorrow when I have backup.
