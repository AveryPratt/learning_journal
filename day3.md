# Day 3

Today was refactoring day for me. Since I had jumped the gun on using functions in the javascript for my about_me page yesterday, and we're doing paired programming tomorrow, I had to refactor my code to exclude functions. Which meant pretty much starting over completely. Then I started getting too fancy again, so I had to refactor my second draft. By the end of the day, I had completed a 275-line javascript page, but if you count the refactoring and the other work I did, it was probably more like 400-500 lines of code. Not bad for the third day. CSS was being annoying as ussual, but Kenneth showed me a website called Flexbox Froggy, which is helpful because it summarizes how to do difficult css tricks by turning the layout of the page into a game. I'm looking forward to tomorrow because I've never done paired programming before, and I imagine that it would be good to have someone to bounce ideas off of and work with.
