# Day 2

It looks like "sandbox mode" is now in full effect, which makes me happy. If there was one thing I could change, it would be to have the morning lecture divided up into sections throughout the day rather than spewing 3 hours of information at us before we get a chance to try things out on our own. But nevertheless, it's good to be coding our own projects without too much assistance. There was a period of time where Sam and the TAs (that sounds like a lame band name when you say it out loud) were having a meeting, and another student had a question, so I got a chance to step in and help out. It would be great if as the class progresses, we feel as comfortable asking each other for help as we do asking the TA's. My biggest fear right now is JavaScript's type coercion. It's painful for me to decalre variables without specifying the data type, and the fact that the compilor doesn't care if I add 3 and '4' together scares the crap out of me. I hope we learn the rules of type coercion sooner rather than later, or we'll probably be dealing with a lot of bugs.
