# Day 7

I had another fun time with this assignment. I noticed today that I'm working a lot faster, but mainly because I've been getting better with atom and the terminal, not just JavaScript. After finishing my assignment earlier than I anticipated, I decided to add some functionality that Ford had asked about yesterday: modeling the customer data to reflect a function over time. I decided to stick to simple functions for now, but tomorrow I might try more complex ones if I have the time.
