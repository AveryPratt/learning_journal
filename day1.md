# Day 1

Whew. It's midnight, and all I can say is that I'm happy I saved this assignment for last and not the one that actually involves coding. So yeah, long day, but it was definitely fun. My learning path took on a couple of forms today, one being frantically matching pace with the instructor while learning to use git, and the other trying to keep myself entertained while going over the basics of html and css. Of course I won't be in the later situation for much longer. It is interesting to observe the differences between self-teaching and learning in a classroom environment. The html and css, while somewhat trivial, still filled in a lot of the cracks that were inevitably left-over from my experience teaching myself. If this were a paired programming environment and not a class-room, I think it would be the perfect way to learn. Luckily, I'll get to experience that later on too! As for the harder stuff surrounding git and the command line, I'm planning on showing up at least half an hour early every day that I have a question, which includes today. I'll keep this entry short and sweet, since I'm so tired, but in the future, I may just combine this journal with my blog that I started on my website (the day before I figured out I had to keep a journal). Goodbye for now!
