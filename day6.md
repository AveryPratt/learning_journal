# Day 6

Today was actually really smoothe. I finally feel like I've spent enough time around javascript that it's starting to become natural and not feel like a distorted version of C#. That being said, I still have a ways to go to really become comfortable with it, and I'm still alarmed at how flexible they made the syntax to avoid throwing errors (type coercion still scares me to death). I'm glad that we're running full speed into the more advanced concepts, because that's where I need the most work, plus it's funner and I get to try to help out other people. It won't be much longer though before the class gets into topics where I have absolutely no experience. Certainly by the time we start learning AngularJS, NodeJS, and JQuery I'll be just as confused as everyone else.
