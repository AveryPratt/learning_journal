# Day 15

Whoopsie. This assignment is late. As well as a few of my project reports. Somehow, shifting gears over the weekend for project week caused me to neglect my canvas assignments. However, the project is coming along really well. The thing I was most worried about was being put in a team with people who didn't want to do more than the bare minimum, and that is absolutely not the case. One of my goals today that I didn't achieve was spending more time on css. After implementing my turn counter algorithm, I started tinkering with it a little bit, but I kept being drawn back into js because that's what needed the most work for the goals our team set today. Tomorrow there will probably be another chance since we're basically creating a new scoreboard and there will be additional elements to style. On a side note, Mike from Python 401 tested our game today and was impressed.
