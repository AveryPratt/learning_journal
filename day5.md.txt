# Day 3

Yikes I had a bad weekend! If there's one mistake I'm NOT going to repeat, it will be procrastinating. Not even for 24 hours over the weekend. I finished Friday strong, with the lab done, and my new about_me page nearing completion. Then on Saturday, I figured I had enough progress that I could take an overnight trip to Portland to celebrate my roommate's birthday. I planned on bringing my laptop just in case, but Microsoft decided to throw a gigantic mandatory update right before we left, and I was forced to leave it updating on my desk. No problem, though, I'll still get back and have over 6 hours to finish the assignment, right? Well, 6 hours goes by fast when your code is full of bugs. I had to submit my assignment without fully debugging it and then resubmit once I had finished it an hour and a half later, so my grade is probably going to take a bit of a dip. Anyways, I hear week 2 is going to be the toughest week in 201, so I'd better get as much sleep as I can.
