# Day 13

Today was the first day I stayed longer than Kenneth, which was quite and achievement. I ended up going home around 9:15, which is a personal record. Unfortunately, I didn't get a lot of things done that I wanted to, so I decided to write all my goals for tomorrow in the issues section of github, so I don't end up working on a bunch of different things and creating more problems for myself. Tomorrow will also be a long day if I want to get those done though.

The paired programming today went well. Sugey and I worked on her code almost the whole time, which went from not displaying images to a fully functional chart. We didn't get around to local storage before she had to head home, but if we agreed to meet up again tomorrow, I doubt it would take more than an hour to fulfill the requirements. I'm also going to mull over some ideas for project pitches on the bus tomorrow.
