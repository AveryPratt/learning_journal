# Day 12

Charts are fun! I also noticed that chart.js is open source, so the more I familiarize myself with it, the sooner I can actually contribute (and build up a kick-ass resume). I did notice a glaring bug, which I wasn't able to find by the end of today; I implemented a function to sort the data in the chart based on its values. However, when I hover over the data, sometimes the order of the bars changes for no apparent reason. Of course, it's highly likely that the bug is in my code rather than chart.js seeing as I'm completely unfamiliar with how most of it works. That being said, it's a bug that is seemingly impossible to find without looking through chart.js' code to find out how I'm using it wrong. Anyways, that's a problem I'll get around to tomorrow if I have the time.
